**Solution:** Install missing package with `pip install <package_name>`

### Issue: "CSV file not found"
**Solution:** Ensure `data/heart_disease.csv` exists in correct path

### Issue: Out of Memory
**Solution:** Reduce `batch_size` from 64 to 32 in code

### Issue: Low accuracy
**Solution:** 
- Verify data quality
- Increase training epochs
- Adjust hyperparameters
- Check for data leakage

### Issue: Slow training (CPU only)
**Solution:** Install TensorFlow with GPU support (requires NVIDIA GPU)
